## Zero Hunger
Zero Hunger is a web-based application built on the .NET framework with a front-end created using scaffolding. The project aims to address the issue of food waste and promote efficient food distribution. It provides a platform for restaurants to post their surplus food items on a dashboard, making them available for individuals in need.

The application supports four types of users: admin, employee, restaurant, and requester. Each user has specific roles and responsibilities within the system.

The restaurant users have the ability to post details about the food items they have available for donation on the dashboard. However, they cannot sell the food items and must include an expiry date to ensure the safety of the food.

Any user, including requesters, can access the dashboard and view the available food items. If a particular food item is not expired, a requester can request it by submitting a request through the system.

Once a request is made, it is forwarded to the admin for review and assignment. The admin is responsible for managing and coordinating the food distribution process. They review the requests and assign an employee to fulfill each request.

The assigned employee receives information about the requester and the food item, and their role is to collect the food from the restaurant and deliver it to the requester. This process ensures efficient and timely food distribution, reducing food waste and helping individuals in need.

Overall, Zero Hunger is a project that leverages technology to connect surplus food providers, such as restaurants, with individuals who can benefit from the donated food. By streamlining the food distribution process and involving various user roles, the project aims to contribute to the goal of eliminating hunger and reducing food waste in the community.
